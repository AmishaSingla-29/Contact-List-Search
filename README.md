# Contact_List_Search
This project implements the ‘Autocomplete’ functionality. We often use websites or applications where we try to input something into the box and then we get some suggestions. This is done by the data structure called Tries which is a type of Tree. In this project we can add or delete a number basically a contact. We can also search it.
